# PyDictionary

PyDictionary is an offline English dictionary made using Python along with the Wordnet Lexical Database and Enchant Spell Dictionary. The project is a very simple one made to understand the complete functionality of Wordnet and to test the extent of its resources. The application returns any query with a list of results - the various word forms and their meanings along with a sample sentence using the given word.

PyDictionary is a complete project, and can be used as a full fledged offline English dictionary. Although limited, it does the same job Google search does when searched with a word.
